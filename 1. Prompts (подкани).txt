Hello, my task today is to work together with you to write a short story (about 3000 words minimum). The story should consist of three parts - beginning (where the introduction is made), middle (where the action happens), and end (where the story is finished) .The genre of the story I have chosen is fantasy. It should contain magic, adventure and maybe mystery.
I want to begin with defining three characters, then three locations - each location should be used to supplement the beginning, middle and end accordingly.
Afterward I will ask you some html and css questions, as I have to create a small webpage where I must shocase my story. I will enhance the webpage with images of the locations and the characters, so their descriptions should be well made.
You can provide me with a simple prompt plan that I can follow in order to finish all these tasks.
