          In the neon-lit streets of New Babylon, the once-great cityscape lay
          in ruins, a testament to the devastation wrought by nuclear World War
          III. Amidst the rubble and the remnants of humanity, a new era of
          conflict emerged—the non-nuclear World War IV. Despite the desolation
          that surrounded them, the thirst for power and dominance persisted,
          fueling the flames of war that engulfed the world. At the heart of
          this relentless conflict stood the cybertech-enhanced soldiers known
          simply as Models. These warriors, their humanity sacrificed in
          exchange for power, became faceless instruments of destruction wielded
          by those who sought to control the fate of humanity. Among them, Model
          2 emerged as a relic of a bygone era, a weathered veteran whose
          once-human features were now obscured by the cold steel of cybernetic
          enhancements. Unlike many of their comrades, Model 2 fought not for
          glory or conquest, but for the elusive dream of freedom—a dream that
          had long since faded from the hearts of those who fought alongside
          them. Opposing Model 2 was the latest iteration, Model 10, a pristine
          symbol of efficiency and ruthlessness. Enhanced to perfection, Model
          10 embodied the status quo—a staunch defender of the oppressive
          regimes that sought to maintain control through fear and force. As the
          two models clashed on the battlefield, their conflict epitomized the
          struggle between the old ways and the relentless march of progress.
          Caught in the crossfire was a young mechanic, their hands stained with
          grease and their heart burdened by the weight of a world torn apart by
          endless conflict. Despite the chaos that surrounded them, the mechanic
          clung to a fragile hope—a hope that someday, the cycle of violence
          would be broken, and peace would prevail. As tensions reached a
          boiling point, Model 2 and Model 10 found themselves on a collision
          course, their paths converging on the blood-soaked streets of New
          Babylon. The air crackled with anticipation as the two warriors stood
          face to face, their eyes locked in a silent exchange of defiance and
          determination. But amidst the looming threat of violence, the mechanic
          stepped forward, their voice trembling with emotion as they begged for
          reason in a world consumed by madness. Their words hung in the air
          like a desperate plea for salvation, a beacon of hope amidst the
          darkness that threatened to consume them all. And as the first sparks
          of conflict ignited, casting their shadows against the broken skyline,
          the fate of humanity hung in the balance, teetering on the edge of
          oblivion.

          What they have yet to notice are the cracks of the secure outer layer
          of the research facility. The place where they were born. New Babylon
          was the center of Model research, now battlefield. The secrets soon to
          be unveiled.
